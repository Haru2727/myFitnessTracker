## Installation

    One can install this app by cloning the repo from my github, then typing npm i && npm start to connect to the server.  Then visit localhost:3005 to use it.

## Usgae

    As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts.  I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day.  I should be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of the exercise.  If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled as well.
